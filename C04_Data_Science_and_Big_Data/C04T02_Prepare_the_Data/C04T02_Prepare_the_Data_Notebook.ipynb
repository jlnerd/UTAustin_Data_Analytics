    "__FROM__: Michael Ortiz <br>\n",
    "__Subject:__ Next Steps: Collect and Prepare Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello,\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you’re ready to use EMR to collect the web data you will analyze to provide the general sentiment toward the smart phones. The data you will need to collect is in the web database compiled by Common Crawl.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work you will do in EMR involves running scripts that will access and compile web pages from the Common Crawl that are relevant to smart phones (the most helpful web pages are those that contain a smart phone review), count the number of positive, negative, or uncertain sentiments expressed, and then store this data in an S3 repository folder. As you can imagine, accessing and compiling all this data will take quite a while; but the good news is that there’s no need to write the scripts to do it—the previous analyst that was working on this project, Amy Gorman, has already written and tested the three Python programs that will help you accomplish your task (I’ve attached them to this eMail). You should take a look at these programs to see how they were written, but here is what they do: the “mapper” script examines and counts data from portions of the Common Crawl data, the “reducer” script accumulates the analysis from the individual mapper jobs, and the “aggregation” script helps stitch together the raw output from the multiple job flows you will need to initiate to analyze all the necessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the high-level view of what the scripts do. The details of it are that the mapper script scans the Common Crawl data for a smart phone name (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Nokia Lumia, etc.) and also scans for the words review, critique, looks at, in depth, analysis, evaluate, evaluation, and assess. If the mapper finds any of these words and a reference to one of the phones we are interested in, then the number of instances is recorded for the relevant device. Then the mapper scans and records instances of words related to the features of the phones, such as camera, display, or performance, that also have a positive, negative, or uncertain word within a 5-14 words. When this sentiment toward a specific phone feature is found, the mapper emits a count for each of the instances it observes. The mapper is sending this information back to the reducer, which is running on a master node. The reducer accumulates the information it receives from the mappers and writes it to the output file on S3. The result of all this can be seen in the sample data matrix that Amy Gorman constructed from the data she was able to access. This matrix was attached to my previous eMail.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your Job__\n",
    "\n",
    "What I’d like you to do is run the script on 400 to 500 Common Crawl archive files and collect as many web pages as you can that contain references to smart phones. Because this process requires a lot of time and computing resources, avoiding errors is essential. That’s why I’d like you to start by running the script on just one Common Crawl archive file using the EMR console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once you get the hang of the process, I’d like you to ramp up your efforts by running the script from a command line, as this will be more efficient for starting multiple \"steps\" that scan large ranges of archive files. As I said, your goal should be to compile data from 400 to 500 archive files. This should give you around 20,000 web pages that contain references to smart phones. When you get more than 20,000 results it is permissible to keep moving forward in the plan of attack or you may choose to map more files and add more to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've collected this data (the script stores this output in S3), I'd like you to consolidate it into a Large Matrix similar to the Sample Matrix Amy created. To do this, you will need the concatenate.py file that Amy used to compile her Sample Matrix results. I've attached it to this eMail. \n",

    "You have been asked by Michael Ortiz, VP of Alert Analytics, to use EMR to collect the web data you will analyze to provide the general sentiment toward the smart phones and compile it into a csv file called the Large Matrix. This involves first running the mapper and reducer scripts on one WET file of Common Crawl data in EMR using the EMR console. Then you will run the scripts in EMR on 400 to 500 Common Crawl WET files using the EMR Command Line Interface. Lastly you will use the concatenating script to compile the Common Crawl data you have collected and to create the Large Matrix and submit your file. \n",

    "* Large Data Matrix — a csv file generated by running the Python Mapper and Reducer programs on 400 to 500 Common Crawl WET files (approximately a billion pages) and meets the following requirements:\n",
    "     * Is initiated by the command line interface using JSON job files that either you have created or that have been provided to you. It is OK to expand upon JSON files provided to crawl more segments of the Common Crawl.\n",

    "     * Contains a minimum of 20,000 instances, but should contain as many as you are reasonably able to gather. This number can be increased by expanding the number of common crawl WET file addresses your JSON file specifies for processing."

    "        * Under 'Add Steps'\n",
    "        * Auto-Terminate: Ensure you check Auto Terminate. If you do not set your clusters to 'Auto-Terminate' they will continue to run and you will continue to be charged.\n",

    "    3. After clicking 'Configure' a new pop-up widow will open and allow you to enter the specific parameters for the step you'll be adding.\n",
    "    4. Specify parameters: In this step you will fill in the following information:\n",
    "       * Mapper location: You previously loaded the reducer script to an S3 bucket. It is from this bucket that EMR runs your script. Here you are telling EMR the location of that bucket. Use the dark Folder Symbol to the right of the form field and navigate to your mapper.\n",
    "       * Reducer location: You previously loaded the mapper script to an S3 bucket. It is from this bucket that EMR runs your script. Here you are telling EMR the location of that bucket. Use the dark Folder Symbol.\n",
    "       * Input location: Common Crawl keeps their web segment data in an S3 bucket on AWS. This field is asking for the URL of the Common Crawl WET file you want to access. Cut and paste the address you previously created.\n",
    "       * Output location: The output location will be the unique S3 bucket you created for the output of this script run. Use the dark File Symbol. NOTE: after mapping to your output folder will need to add the name of a folder to the end of the address. This is the folder you want EMR to create when the step executes - EMR will not overwrite folders that currently exist in the S3 output folder.\n",
    "       * Extra arguments: This field does not require any input, but here is an explanation of what it is used for: This field gives you the option to introduce any extra arguments into the job. For some Hadoop Streaming job (not for this course) you may need to specify that the input files are in sequence file format – a file format used by the Common Crawl to store text data in a compressed manner.\n",
    "       * Action on failure: This parameter tells EMR what to do if this step fails. \"Continue\" would simply move on to the next step in your streaming program if you had one. \"Cancel and wait\" keeps the cluster running, but does not move on to a new step. \"Terminate Cluster\" will do exactly that: shut down the cluster. \"Continue\" and \"Terminate\" are appropriate settings for your current project. \n",

Examples of instance types include: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized. In the case of this task, we suggest you stick with default instances only. \n",
    "    * Request spot instance: Checking this box allows the user to re-buy (at a discount) unused CPU time from partially complete jobs that other EMR customers have run (for instance if a one-minute job was provisioned but the job only took 30 seconds). Though the job will be cheaper, it usually takes longer. As long as you start this with plenty of time before the due date (at least a week), you can use this feature to save money. We recommend you do not use this doing real-world development, as it will increase job run times and slow your productivity.\n",
    "    * Core/task instance count: This number you input here defines the size of your Hadoop network. Increase or decrease the number of core instances depending on the amount of resources you anticipate you will need for a particular job. We recommend using one master node and two core nodes for each job. When you are ready to process large numbers of segments (such as twenty or more), you should start multiple parallel jobs with this configuration. This can be accomplished conveniently by using the command line interface and JSON job files (examples provided).\n",
