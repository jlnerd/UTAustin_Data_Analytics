The model that we will be using is the Linear Regression Model, which is helpful when trying to discover the relationship between  two variables. These two variables represent the X and Y within the linear equation. The X variable is the predictor variable, also k nown as the independent variable because it doesnâ€™t depend on other attributes while making predictions. Y is the response variable,  also known as the dependent variable because its value depends on the other variables.  (We will be keeping this at a high level. If  youâ€™d like to discover more about this equation, please feeI free to do your own research.) In our case, these two variables will be  Speed and Distance. We are trying to predict Distance, so it is our dependent/response/Y variable. Speed is our independent/predictor /X variable.
